<h3 id="it-started">It started</h3>

<p>Everything started before I understood what was going on. I never fitted in, <strong>something always felt wrong</strong> and I was sure that there was something missing.</p>

<p>That started as soon as I started to know myself when I was about 5 years old. Even though I was nerdy/geekish and I always looked forward to video games, computers, etc. When it came to toys and clothes,<em>I always wanted the ones that wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be for boys</em>.</p>

<h3 id="i-was">I was&hellip;</h3>

<p>I was told at a really early age all that stuff was not for me, in a very mean way. So I never asked for it, but I craved for it. I think that&rsquo;s why I never liked to get clothes as present, in comparison to now.</p>

<p>But as I grew older, I knew I was different, I knew what I wanted and it was afflicting me. <em>You don&rsquo;t know how much it can hurt you to feel you can&rsquo;t be yourself</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Until I couldn&rsquo;t stand it anymore.</em></strong></p>

<p>That day, drown in tears. I came out to the first person ever, a really close friend. I told her how I felt and what I wanted. I was scared, I thought she may think I was a weirdo, or a pervert. But she was supportive and for the first time I felt I could express myself the way I really wanted to. The same day I asked her to help me to get my very first clothes. <em>Feminine clothes</em>. <em>Clothes that fitted my taste</em>, <strong><em>that I always wanted to use</em></strong>.</p>

<p>At that point I wasn&rsquo;t sure about me, to be honest I&rsquo;m not even that sure now, but I knew I liked girls (feminine guys worked for me too) and I didn&rsquo;t mind having a kinky friend between my legs. But at the same time <em>I wanted to look like a girl</em> and behave like one (at least most of the time).</p>

<h3 id="i-am">I am&hellip;</h3>

<p>This day I know <em>I&rsquo;m a transgender</em>, bigender to be more precise. And to this day I also know I&rsquo;m not wrong, thanks to all my close friends that have smothered me the way I am and to my lovely girlfriend that is with me in all this. Thanks to them I also know that I can be loved the same way as a any other person and I should be treated the same way too. (if you are against LGBT, this is when you can unfriend me)</p>

<p>I hope people here understand, I hope some day people all around the world will understand.</p>

<p>And I want you all to know this is the real me, because I don&rsquo;t feel like hiding it anymore.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;ll be a long way, and I&rsquo;ll take baby steps. But I don&rsquo;t want to hide, Not anymore.</p>

<p>Feel free to ask me anything.</p>
