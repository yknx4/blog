      <title>women developers done wrong</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t take me wrong, seeking for more women in the technology world is a legit purpose and I support it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://fusion.net/story/115998/survey-says-92-percent-of-software-developers-are-men/&#34;&gt;92&lt;/a&gt;% of the developers are men&lt;/strong&gt;, and that&amp;rsquo;s a huge gap that makes things unfair sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But current movements are doing it wrong, sooo wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the activities that looks forward to bring more women to the developer side are like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come to the Ultrasuperduper development fair only for women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join us at the girls only programmer&amp;rsquo;s day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the women&amp;rsquo;s only developer community&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re fighting a gender polarized environment with&amp;hellip;.  Another gender polarized environment ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They want to pursue a equitable environment where there&amp;rsquo;s an equal number of men and women by making women only groups.  Doesn&amp;rsquo;t that sounds ridiculous?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I think they&amp;rsquo;re taking the wrong approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll take nightclubs as example. They don&amp;rsquo;t look for the same legit purpose but have the same objective: have more women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Usually there are more men than women&lt;/em&gt; in nightclubs. Why? I don&amp;rsquo;t care, but that&amp;rsquo;s a fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nightclub owners needs to have a partner for every guy in the party, so they don&amp;rsquo;t get bored and obviously to consume more drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if there more men than women looking for nightclubs, &lt;strong&gt;they need to look for strategies to get more women inside&lt;/strong&gt;. And I can assure you they will never make a girls only nightclub. That&amp;rsquo;d be stupid, and &lt;strong&gt;that&amp;rsquo;d mean wasting half of the possible customers (in our case developers).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What they do, is to make the place a little more attractive to women. Lowered prices, better seats, no cover, etc&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s not about getting rid of the males so you can get more women, is about lurking women that was not interested with attractive offers that convince them to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So back in the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They should try to make events attractive to women, but not limited to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about a programming course free for woman, but men for a small fee can join too. Or even  better, for a men to join he has to bring two female pals interested in learning about development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know, there should be a lot of ways of making these events more interesting for women without excluding men. And that&amp;rsquo;s how it has to be done. I think this way this movements can improve a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after all, this is just my opinion. &lt;strong&gt;In a perfect world, nobody would give a f*ck if you&amp;rsquo;re men or women.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW&amp;hellip; I thought about this because recently I saw a lot of interesting development events, but they were limited to women only.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>There&#39;s no gender violence at all</title>
      <link>//yknx4.github.io/blog/article/theres-no-gender-violence-at-all/</link>

      <guid>//yknx4.github.io/blog/article/theres-no-gender-violence-at-all/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As some of you may know today is the Women&amp;rsquo;s Day and &lt;strong&gt;this ain&amp;rsquo;t a day to celebrate but to commemorate all those women that have fought for women&amp;rsquo;s rights&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even though I agree with that, I still feel uneasy due to the fact that &lt;strong&gt;gender violence against men is usually not addressed&lt;/strong&gt;, at least not the same way and things get worse when you talk about non-traditional genders. And so sometimes I feel these kind of commemoration isn&amp;rsquo;t fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in all the flow of posts about the international women&amp;rsquo;s day I saw this pic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://yknx4.github.io/blog/images/gender_violence.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;No Gender Violence&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It says &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;there no such a thing as gender violence, gender itself is violence&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;.
And then everything clicked, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t agree more with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;root&lt;/strong&gt; of all gender violence is &lt;strong&gt;gender itself&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue is for boys, Pink is for girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short hair for boys, Long hair for girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pants for boys, Skirts for girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rude for boys, Cute for girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sports is for boys, Dance is for girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and so on&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people still live with this guidelines their lifes, even worse teach their kids that&amp;rsquo;s how they are supposed to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s the problem, since we were kids we were taught (at least that&amp;rsquo;s in Mexico) that girls have to be soft, cute, and fragile while boys have to be tough, rude, and strong. And so the stereotypes of a weak girl and a strong boy were buried on our enviroment, society, and life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these were the reason 60 years ago, women were not allowed to vote, to work, to ask, to choose, to everything. And lots and lots of womens fought to overcome this, those women are the women we commemorate in this days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the same &lt;em&gt;guidelines&lt;/em&gt; removing the gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue is for persons, Pink is for persons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short hair for persons, Long hair for persons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pants for persons, Skirts for persons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rude for persons, Cute for persons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sports is for persons, Dance is for persons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and so on&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If society lived with this, there would never be a comparison between, there would never be sterotypes, there would be only persons, no weak girls, no strong boys only persons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limiting how a person is supposed to be just because of the fact that he was born with or without something between the legs it&amp;rsquo;s really stupid. And sadly these days most of this still holds true, when it cames to non cisgender persons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a &lt;strong&gt;boy wants to be pretty&lt;/strong&gt;, put on makeup and wear a skirt, or a &lt;strong&gt;girl wants to look rude&lt;/strong&gt;, have short hair and wear saggy pants, &lt;strong&gt;Gender violence is still there&lt;/strong&gt;. Even when nowadays everyone is fine with girls wearing the once male-only clothes &lt;em&gt;pants&lt;/em&gt;, a boy wearing a skirt is treated as obscene, dirty, perverted, etc&amp;hellip; and I don&amp;rsquo;t see people commemorating boy&amp;rsquo;s day, or Male&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt; movement fighting for gender equality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s stop fighting Gender Violence, and let&amp;rsquo;s figth Gender itself. We got to remove all these sterotypes. Let&amp;rsquo;s not fight for women&amp;rsquo;s rights, let&amp;rsquo;s figth for &lt;strong&gt;REAL&lt;/strong&gt; human rights. Rights that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t discriminate by sex nor gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust me when i say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If we get rid of Genders, we get rid of all gender issues. Including violence&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
